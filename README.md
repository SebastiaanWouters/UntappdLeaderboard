The goal is to create a website with a leaderboard between my friends based on untappd.com data. This way, it's easy to see who has drunk the most unique beers etc... (Current version: http://arne.ulyssis.be/Untappd/)

Thanks to https://github.com/WebBreacher/untappdScraper for the inspiration and the scripts to scrape untappd.com content.
